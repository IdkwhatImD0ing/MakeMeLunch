# MakeMeLunch

## 💡Inspiration

Our inspiration came from some of the common problems we face in preparing everyday meals. If we don't keep track of what ingredients we have, that zucchini in the forgotten corner of the fridge goes bad, inevitably becoming wasted food. Additionally, repeatedly eating the same dish is a recipe to never wanting to eat said dish ever again. That being said, the same ingredients can make many different dishes, and trying new ideas helps prevent getting sick of repeatedly eating the same foods.

MakeMeLunch is designed to tackle both of these problems, providing an ingredient tracker and its relevant recipes.
