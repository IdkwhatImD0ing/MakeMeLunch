# MakeMeLunch

## 💡Inspiration

Our inspiration came from some common difficulties in preparing everyday meals. Not keeping track of ingredients results in food going bad in the forgotten corner of the fridge, letting it go to waste. Additionally, repeatedly eating the same dish is a recipe to never wanting to eat said dish ever again. That being said, the same ingredients can make many different dishes, and trying new ideas helps prevent getting sick of repeatedly eating the same foods.

MakeMeLunch is designed to tackle both of these problems, providing an ingredient tracker and its relevant recipes.
